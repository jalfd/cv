      <section>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>
          I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Developer position at
          Dalux. As an experienced software developer with around 19 years of
          experience and a Master's in Computer Science, I believe I would be a
          valuable addition to your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my current job I work on a team of 9 developers, building and
          maintaining a complex medical imaging application, which has taught me
          a lot: because of the small team size we haven't had the luxury of
          allowing technical debt to accumulate, and so it has been vital to
          adhere to the agreed architecture, invest in a smooth build system and
          CI/CD pipeline and other tooling to help make our jobs easier.
          Likewise, team members are encouraged to suggest new ideas and
          initiatives to streamline our internal processes and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approach software development as a team effort: I believe that a
          team which works together, and spreads both knowledge and
          responsibilities will be more successful than one dominated by
          individual egos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a big nerd at heart, always curious to deepen my
          understanding of my tools, and have often been the guy called on to
          investigate particularly tricky bugs or figure out ways to identify
          and resolve performance bottlenecks.
        </p>
        <p>
          From everything I have read and heard about working at Dalux, it seems
          like a place that shares many of my values, empowering developers to
          make decisions and pitch new ideas, and which cares not just about new
          features but also about the maintainability and overall health of the
          code base, and it sounds like a place where I could thrive and make a
          positive difference.
        </p>
