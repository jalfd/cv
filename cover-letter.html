          I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Developer position at
          Dalux.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software developer I believe that our discipline is a team sport:
          that a team which works together, shares responsibilities and triese
          to spread knowledge around will always be more productive and more
          pleasant to work on, than one of egos and so-called 10x developers. I
          am also a big nerd at heart, someone who has built a deep technical
          knowledge and has often been the guy coworkers came to when they
          needed to understand a particularly tricky bug, or why their code
          didn't perform as well as they expected. I am easy to get along with,
          always eager to learn more, and I want my work to make a positive
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my current job I work on a team of 9 developers, building and
          maintaining a complex medical imaging application, which has taught me
          many things. Because of the small team size we haven't had the luxury
          of allowing technical debt to accumulate, and so it has been vital to
          adhere to the agreed architecture, invest in a smooth build system and
          CI/CD pipeline, and we have adopted an agile mentality where team
          members were encouraged to suggest new ideas and initiatives to
          streamline our internal processes and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          From everything I have read and heard about working at Dalux, it seems
          like a place that shares many of my values, empowering developers to
          make decisions and pitch new ideas, and which cares not just about new
          features but also about the maintainability and overall health of the
          code base, and it sounds like a place where I would fit in and thrive and be able
          to make a positive difference.
