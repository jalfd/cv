      <section>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>
          I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Developer position at
          Dalux. As an experienced software developer with around 19 years of
          experience and a Masters in Computer Science, I believe I would be a
          valuable addition to your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my current job I work on a team of 9 developers, building and
          maintaining a complex medical imaging application, which has taught me
          many things. Because of the small team size we haven't had the luxury
          of allowing technical debt to accumulate, and so it has been vital to
          adhere to the agreed architecture, invest in a smooth build system and
          CI/CD pipeline and other tooling to help ourselves, and team members
          are encouraged to suggest new ideas and initiatives to streamline our
          internal processes and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, software development is a team sport: I believe that a team
          which works together, shares responsibilities and triese to spread
          knowledge around will always be more successful than one of egos and
          so-called 10x developers.
        </p>
        <p>I have always been curious and eager to
          understand more of what happens when we compile and run our code, and
          as a result I have often been the guy coworkers came to when they
          needed to understand a particularly tricky bug, or why their code
          didn't perform as well as they expected.</p>
        <p>
          From everything I have read and heard about working at Dalux, it seems
          like a place that shares many of my values, empowering developers to
          make decisions and pitch new ideas, and which cares not just about new
          features but also about the maintainability and overall health of the
          code base, and it sounds like a place where I would fit in and thrive
          and be able to make a positive difference.
