          <p>
            Software developer with nearly two decades of experience. I'm a
            positive and open person who values learning and sharing knowledge.
            I thrive as part of a team, and have often been the guy coworkers
            come to both for design and architecture questions and for help
            understanding particularly tricky bugs or quirks of the programming
            language.
