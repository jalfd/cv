        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          For over a decade I have been working on medical imaging software,
          which has presented me with many interesting challenges. The software
          is used on hospitals and clinics where stability, safety and
          performacne are very important. We had a very developer-driven and
          agile team where we frequently adjusted our processes based on what
          worked and what improvements we wished to see, all of which taught me
          many skills, both technical and interpersonal/communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive as a generalist and a problem solver, helping debug tricky
          bugs, profiling and investigating performance issues, or writing
          common libraries and utilities that support the rest of the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a person I am open and positive, eager to learn and to help others
          learn. It is important to me that to work in an inclusive environemnt
          which allows everyone on the team to thrive.

          <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>
            Worked on a medical imaging application written in C++, and running
            on Linux and Windows, consisting of a desktop application written in
            C++, a set of backend services in C++ and Typescript, with support
            for streaming the application to a web browser. As a medical device,
            the application has strict requirements for performance, safety and
            correctness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped promote good coding practices and unit testing to the
            entire team, and became the team's go-to person for performance
            investigations and optimization, and often aided colleagues in
            debugging particularly complex issues.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Part of a project to convert the application's backend services
              from C++ to Typescript.
            </li>

            <li>
              Led a project to adopt OAuth2 authentication for the entire
              application, to align with security best practices and simplify
              user management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led a project to develop a HTML/JS-based streaming client,
              allowing the application to be used in a web browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a test harness for performance testing, allowing us to spot
              performance regressions more easily.
            </li>

            <li>
              Part of a project to optimize the application's VNC-based
              streaming layer, leading to 80% reduction in connection time and
              significantly improved framerates when streaming.
            </li>

            <li>
              Drove major performance improvements, reducing the time key
              performance metrics ("Time to First Image") from ~3 seconds to
              below 1 for most use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with CS teams to troubleshoot customer deployments and
              develop third-party integrations.
