        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I have 14 years of experience as a software developer, mostly working
          on a native (C++) application in the medical imaging domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a huge nerd at heart and have built a deep technical knowledge
          and have often been the guy coworkers went to when they wanted to
          understand an obscure bug, a quirk of the programming language, or why
          a piece of code was slower than expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a person I am open and positive, eager to learn and to help others
          learn. In my experience, software development is a team sport, and I
          find that a willingness to support, teach and help each others across
          a team are crucial to a good development team.

          <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>
            Worked on a medical imaging application written mostly in C++,
            consisting of a Windows desktop application, Linux-based backend
            services in Typescript, and a streaming layer for using the
            application in a web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped promote good coding practices and unit testing to the
            entire team, and became the team's go-to person for performance
            investigations and optimization, and often aided colleagues in
            debugging particularly complex issues.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Part of a project to convert the application's backend services
              from C++ to Typescript.
            </li>

            <li>
              Led a project to adopt OAuth2 authentication for the entire
              application, to align with security best practices and simplify
              user management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led a project to develop a HTML/JS-based streaming client,
              allowing the application to be used in a web browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a test harness for performance testing, allowing us to spot
              performance regressions more easily.
            </li>

            <li>
              Part of a project to optimize the application's VNC-based
              streaming layer, leading to 80% reduction in connection time and
              significantly improved framerates when streaming.
            </li>

            <li>
              Drove major performance improvements, reducing the time key
              performance metrics ("Time to First Image") from ~3 seconds to
              below 1 for most use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with CS teams to troubleshoot customer deployments and
              develop third-party integrations.
